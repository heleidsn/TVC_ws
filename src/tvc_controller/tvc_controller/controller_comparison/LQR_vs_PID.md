# LQR vs PID

LQR is the theory of optimal control is concerned with operating a dynamic system at minimum cost.
The case where the system dynamics are described by a set of linear differential equations and the cost is described by a quadratic function is called the LQ problem. 

The LQR algorithm reduces the amount of work done by the control systems engineer to optimize the controller. However, the engineer still needs to specify the cost function parameters, and compare the results with the specified design goals.
